# My-All_Library

This project demonstrates the creation collection of libraries (data types), `clsChar, clsString, clsDate, clsPeriod, clsDate .......`, in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## Overview

The `My-All_Library` project focuses on implementing fundamental to handle date with custom functionality. The primary objective is to showcase the application of OOP concepts such as encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism in C++.

## Features

- Encapsulation of character and string functionalities
- Custom methods for character and string manipulation
- Support for dynamic memory management
- Illustration of OOP principles in C++
